# Data Subject Access Request Laws
 
The beginnings of a catalogue of U.S. laws that may directly provide for, or else indirectly implicate, the subject access rights of individuals. I'd like to explore the various actors, their roles, the rights of the data subject and the processes for, and consequences of, exercising those rights under each of these laws.

Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)

FERPA (parents exercise on behalf of students) and state equivalents like 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)

US Telecommunications Act of 1996, CPNI

State Laws on Access to Personnel Files, see, e.g:
- California:
[Cal. Lab. Code § § 1198.5; 432](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=1198.5)
Employers affected: All employers subject to wage and hour laws.
Employee access to records: Employee or former employee has right to inspect at reasonable intervals any personnel records relating to performance or to a grievance proceeding. Employer need nto provide records regarding the investigation of a criminal offense, letters or reference, or certain other records. Employer must comply with only one request per year from former employees. This right ceases while a lawsuit brought by the employee based on a personnel matter is pending against the employer. Written request required: Yes. If employee requests file orally, employer must supply form for making request in writing. Conditions for viewing records: Employer must make records available no more than 30 days after receiving written request. Employee may view records at reasonable times, during break or nonwork hours. If records are kept off-site or employer does not make them available at the workplace, then employee must be allowed to view them at the storage location without loss of pay. Copying records: Employee also has a right to a copy of personnel records, within 30 days after making written request.
