# Data Subject Access Request Laws
 
The beginnings of a catalogue of U.S. laws that may directly provide for, or else indirectly implicate, the subject access rights of individuals. I'd like to explore the various actors, their roles, the rights of the data subject and the processes for, and consequences of, exercising those rights under each of these laws.

Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)

FERPA (parents exercise on behalf of students) and state equivalents like 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)

US Telecommunications Act of 1996, CPNI


State Data Privacy Laws
- MA Fair Information Practices Act (FIPA) MGL 66A, Section 2 (Holders maintaining personal data system; duties)

Private company implementations, see, e.g.,:
- [Facebook Personal Data Request](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/180237885820953)
- [Google User Data Request](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1)
